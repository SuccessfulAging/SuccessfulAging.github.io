## Abstract

Background: It has been suggested that maintaining the efficient organization of the brainâ€™s functional connectivity (FC) supports neuroflexibility under neurogenerative stress. This study examined. psychological resilience-related FC in 112 older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).  


Methods: Using a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach, we investigated. reorganization of the orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG)/amygdala (AMG)/hippocampus (HP)/parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) FC according to the different levels of resilience scale.  


Results: Compared with the low resilient group, the high resilient group had greater connectivity strengths between the left inferior OFG and right superior OFG (P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), between the right inferior OFG and left PHG (P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), and between the right middle OFG and left PHG (false discovery rate < 0.05).  


Conclusion: Psychological resilience may be associated with enhancement of the orbitofrontal network in the elderly with MCI.
